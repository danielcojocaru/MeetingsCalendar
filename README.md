# MeetingsCalendar
# Owner: Daniel Cojocaru

# This application is a calendar view for specifying appointments. When items intersect in their date ranges, there's an algorithm that performs a layout to accommodate them. 
In case of no data, it randomly creates meetings for 500 employees, each having at least 200 appointments and maximum 300 in 60 days starting from today.
